# PACKET LAB FOR NEWBIES

Welcome to the **Cisco Packet Tracer Lab Challenges** repository! Here, you'll find a collection of networking exercises that cover a wide range of topics in **network design**, **configuration**, and **security**. The goal is to provide hands-on experience for students, professionals, and enthusiasts who want to sharpen their networking skills.

Whether you're new to networking or looking to test your skills, this repository has something for everyone. Try solving the **unsolved challenges**, explore the solutions in the **solved challenges**, and improve your understanding of core networking concepts.

## Repository Structure

- **`/Solved`**: This folder contains the Packet Tracer files (.pka) that I’ve already solved. These are ready for review, analysis, and learning.
- **`/Unsolved`**: These are the Packet Tracer files that I’ve not solved. They’re up for challenge! Feel free to download, attempt to solve them, and learn from your mistakes (and successes!).

## Available Challenges

### Solved Challenges:

- **8.3.1.3 Packet Tracer - Skills Integrated Challenge**  
  Dive into this integrated challenge where you’ll configure multiple devices, troubleshoot network issues, and optimize network performance. A great test of your overall networking skills!

- **7.4.2.4 Packet Tracer - Server Firewalls and Router ACLs**  
  A challenge focused on securing a network by configuring firewalls and access control lists (ACLs). Perfect for those looking to practice network security concepts.

- **6.2.3.8 Packet Tracer - Router and Switch Redundancy**  
  Redundancy is key in ensuring network uptime. In this challenge, you’ll implement redundant paths and protocols like HSRP to avoid network outages. 

- **4.3.3.4 Packet Tracer - Configuring VPN Tunnel Mode**  
  This challenge walks you through setting up a **VPN Tunnel**, crucial for securely connecting remote networks. Learn about encryption, IPsec, and more.

- **4.3.3.3 Packet Tracer - Configuring VPN Transport Mode**  
  Another VPN challenge! This time, you’ll configure the **Transport Mode** for encrypted communication between two networks. A must for understanding VPNs at a deeper level.

- **3.3.2.7 Packet Tracer - WEP WPA2 PSK WPA2 RADIUS**  
  A challenge about wireless security protocols. You’ll configure and compare **WEP**, **WPA2 PSK**, and **WPA2 RADIUS** to ensure safe wireless communication.

- **2.5.2.7 Packet Tracer - Using File and Data Integrity Checks**  
  File integrity is essential in cybersecurity. This challenge explores how to secure files and data using various checks, an important skill for anyone interested in network security.

- **1.5.3.6 Packet Tracer - Communicating in a Cyber World**  
  Focused on communication protocols, this challenge teaches how devices interact and communicate in a large-scale network. It’s a foundational exercise in network communication.

- **1.5.3.5 Packet Tracer - Creating a Cyber World**  
  The perfect introductory challenge! Here, you’ll set up a basic network and experiment with device configuration, IP addressing, and basic routing. A great starting point for beginners.

### Unsolved Challenges:

This folder contains challenges that are **unsolved**—your mission is to take on these exercises and solve them. By solving these, you’ll gain practical experience with:

- Advanced routing and switching
- Network security and firewalls
- VPN configuration
- Wireless security
- And more!

### How to Get Started

1. **Download Cisco Packet Tracer**:  
   If you don't have it yet, download Cisco Packet Tracer [here](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer) (free for students through the Cisco Networking Academy).

2. **Clone or Download the Repository**:  
   Download this repository and navigate to either the `Solved` or `Unsolved` folder to find the PKA files.

3. **Open and Explore the Challenges**:  
   Open the Packet Tracer file (with the `.pka` extension) in Cisco Packet Tracer and start working through the challenges.

4. **Try to Solve the Unsolved Files**:  
   If you're feeling up for the challenge, grab an unsolved PKA file, read through the instructions, and try to configure the network yourself. After solving, feel free to submit a pull request with your solutions to share with others!

5. **Share Your Solutions and Learn Together**:  
   If you solve any of the unsolved challenges, don’t forget to share your solution by opening a pull request. Feel free to ask for help if you're stuck or want to discuss a particular solution.
